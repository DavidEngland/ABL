This comprehensive document provides:

1. **Complete problem statement** with observational signatures
2. **Curvature framework** with all key equations
3. **Standard formulations** and their limitations
4. **Detailed correction strategies** (G factor, tail modifier, Q-SBL)
5. **Calibration protocol** with diagnostics
6. **Implementation workflow** with pseudocode
7. **Validation protocol** (synthetic, LES, observational)
8. **Advanced topics** (dynamic Ri_c, Ri-based closures, planetary)
9. **Common pitfalls** and troubleshooting
10. **Software/reproducibility** guidelines
11. **Publication roadmap** (3 papers over 24 months)
12. **Training modules** for graduate students
13. **Quick reference tables** and checklists

The document is self-contained, citable, and immediately actionable for implementing curvature-aware SBL corrections in operational models.
