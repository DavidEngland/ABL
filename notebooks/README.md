# Curvature Demo — Quick run instructions

Open notebook in Google Colab (replace USERNAME/REPO with your GitHub path):

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/USERNAME/REPO/blob/main/notebooks/Curvature_Demo.ipynb)

If you prefer to run locally:

1. Create and activate a venv or conda env.
2. Install dependencies:
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Launch JupyterLab or Notebook:
   - jupyter lab

Notes:
- The notebook includes a top-cell that runs `pip install -r ../requirements.txt` for Colab convenience.
- If you use Binder, point Binder to the repo root and it will use requirements.txt to build the environment.
